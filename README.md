Code and powerpoint for DotNet Oxford 2021

## Introduction

"F# empowers everyone to write succinct, robust and performant code" - fsharp.org

## F# Software Foundation

Join the [F# Software Foundation](<https://fsharp.org/>). It's free and it then allows you to join the F# Slack channel.

## Presentation

This session will be broken into three parts (separated by very short breaks)...

- Part 1 - Getting Started with F#
  - Expressive type system
  - Composition with |>
  - Pattern matching
  - Collections
  - The REPL
- Part 2 - Starting F# Web Programming with Giraffe
- Part 3 - Experience Report: Building and Running an F# Cloud-Based Service in Production

You may have heard many things about F#. In this presentation, you will get the chance to see for yourselves what F# is and isn't. Yes, it is excellent for those complex domains like finance or data science but what is less well-known is that it is really, really good for the line of business apps that most devs write every day.

The target audience for this session are C# devs. No actual experience of F# is required.
